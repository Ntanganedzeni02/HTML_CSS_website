    <p> Good day, my name is Ntanganedzeni Phidzaglima. I am a passionate and driven individual who thrives on turning challenges into opportunities. I am deeply committed to continuous learning, innovation, and making a meaningful impact in both my field and my community. I believe in pushing boundaries, embracing new experiences, and inspiring others to believe in their potential. <br />
      Throughout my university years, I explored more than just academics. From tutoring peers and competing in hackathons to leading student initiatives, this is a look into how I grew inside and outside the lecture halls</p>
