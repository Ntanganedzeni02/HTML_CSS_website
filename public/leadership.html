      <p>
        My leadership journey reflects my ability to inspire and create impact.
        I have served as Secretary and Vice President of the UWC IT Society,
        Chairperson of the Geekulcha Student Society, and a leader in Women in
        Computer Science. These roles strengthened my communication, project
        management, and teamwork skills while allowing me to mentor and motivate
        others. Leadership for me was never just about titles—it was about
        building inclusive, collaborative, and empowering tech spaces.
