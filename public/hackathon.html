      <h1>Hackathon & Tech Challenges</h1>

      <section class="introduction">
        <p>
          Hackathons were more than competitions; they became defining moments in my journey as a developer.  
          The 2022 Internet of Things (IoT) Hackathon, in particular, revealed my deep interest in technology.  
          Through building, testing, failing, and innovating alongside passionate teammates, I discovered how much I enjoy solving real-world problems with code.
          <br /><br />
          The IoT Hackathon was co-hosted by the University of the Western Cape and Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences.
          We collaborated in cross-cultural teams to develop smart transportation solutions,
          applying skills in IoT hardware, Python programming, and systems design.
          This experience strengthened my ability to integrate hardware with software and confirmed my passion for creating technology that benefits society.

            <h3>SANReN Cybersecurity Challenge Finals 2022</h3>
            <p>
              Collaborated with a national team to tackle real cybersecurity scenarios including
              web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, digital forensics, open-source intelligence (OSINT),
              phishing simulations, and offensive/defensive network security.
              This challenge enhanced my critical thinking, secure-system design,
              and ethical responsibility in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.
