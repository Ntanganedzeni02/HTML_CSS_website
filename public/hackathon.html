      <h1>Hackathon & Tech Challenges</h1>
      <div class="introduction">
        <p>
          Hackathons werenâ€™t just competitions, they were defining moments. The
          IoT Hackathon in 2022, in particular, made me realize I wanted to stay
          in tech. Through building, failing, and innovating with others, I
          found direction and passion in solving real problems with code. <br />
          Co-hosted by the University of the Western Cape and Neu-Ulm University
          of Applied Sciences <br />
          Collaborated in cross-cultural teams to develop smart transportation
          solutions <br />
          Utilized skills in IoT, Python programming, and systems design. The
          experience sparked my passion for solving societal problems through
          technology

            <h3>SANRen Cybersecurity Challenge finals 2022</h3>
            <p>
              Worked on real-world cybersecurity problems across various
              domains: Web exploitation, Reverse engineering, Cryptography,
              forensics, (OSINT), Phishing, and attack and defense <br />
              Strengthened my understanding of secure systems, critical

            <h3>IBM DATATHON 2024</h3>
            <p>
              During the IBM Datathon, my team and I built a web app using
              Jupyter Notebooks to detect AI-generated content, including
              deepfakes, phishing emails, and synthetic text. This challenge
              deepened my understanding of AI misuse and strengthened my skills
              in machine learning, data analysis, and cybersecurity.
