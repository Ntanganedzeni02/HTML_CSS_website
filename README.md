# HTML_CSS_website
This is a personal project that showcases my journey outside the lecture halls during my years at university. From tutoring and leadership to national hackathons, this website highlights the experiences that shaped me beyond academics. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, it reflects both my story and my growth in tech, community, and problem-solving.
